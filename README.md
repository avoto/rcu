Ractive.js component spec
=========================

This repository will eventually provide a complete specification for Ractive.js components, along with the canonical set of utilities needed to implement a component loader.

In the meantime, refer to these implementations:

* [ractive-load](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive-load) - standalone plugin
* [requirejs-ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/requirejs-ractive) - for use with [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/)
* [ractify](https://github.com/marcello3d/node-ractify/) by [marcello3d](https://github.com/marcello3d) - for use with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
